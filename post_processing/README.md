<h2>OpenMMS Post-Processing Software</h2>

| IMPORTANT NOTE | 
| ---------------|
| The current OpenMMS Hardware utilizes an Applanix GNSS-INS sensor, and therefore requires the use of the Applanix POSPac UAV (or MMS) software application in order to process the .T04 file collected from the sensor. **Currently, POSPac can ONLY be installed within a Windows OS environment.** |

<p>These command-line-based Python3 applications are installed on a user's computer, and provide the user with a set of tools for handling all the required MMS data related tasks. The applications have been optimized for performance and speed by utilizing multi-core processing whenever possible.</p>
